					<h1>My Life: </h1>
						</div>
				
					<div id="about">
					<p>I am 17 years old, born in January 17, 1998. I go to Western High School, and currently enrolled in AP 2D art, which is mostly Photography and Photoshop. I want to use this website for my AP art class, to showcase my work, especially to include in my portfolio for college.</p>
					<p>For a career I want to become a Psychologist, and possibly leaning more towards Forensic Psychology. I want to be a forensic psychologist because I find the criminal mind fascinating because they are acting out of the normal, and I want to know what makes people behave the way they do, and if I could help them. My second choice in career would deal with space, it is something that I have always thought about, even as young, as how big space actually is, and how much is actually out there. I would like to discover planets and stars, and even black holes, also see and find out about black matter and things like that. </p>
					<p>Throughout my life, I have had 2 turtles, 2 cats, 2 dogs, and 3 fish. My cat, Kitt, currently is about 7 years old, and lazy.</p>
					<p>I have 2 brothers, Stephon and Darren, and 1 sister, Jonean. My brothers both have daughters, one is 7 years old and the other is 4 years old. It always makes me feel older then what I am when I know that I have neices, though it is not that much of a big deal. It makes me worry, that I feel older with neices, because how would I feel when I become a grandmother?</p>
					<p>My favorite tv shows to watch are: Modern Family, Law and Order, Family Guy, and Spongebob. My favorite Movies are: The Lion King, Tarzan, and Seven Pounds. One of my favorite actors is Will Smith, I believe that he is one of the few down to earth celebrities, and he doesn't let the fame get to his head. At least that is what it seems. I also like singing to the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song, especially the extended version.</p>

						<p>Reading-The link provided is of the bookstore I often get my books from. I have a "library" in my room, and I currently have about 83 books in it, mostly composed of Fantasy books, which are my favorite. I have enjoyed reading for as long as I can remember, even when in 1st grade and reading Island as is-land.</p>
						<p>Gaming-I started getting into games from my cousin, when he introduced me to a game called Runescape, and I woke up at about 10 in the morning and stayed awake until about 4 in the morning, playing this game. After that I moved on to different games, like Minecraft or WoW (World of Warcraft).</p>
						<p>Cooking-I recently started getting into cooking, because of Youtube or Facebook, with people showcasing what they made simply out of Nutella and marshmellows, and I really wanted to do that. The first thing I tried to make was Tomato soup, specifically the one from <a href="http://medievaltimes.com/" style="color: blue; "> Medival Times </a> and I pretty much ended up with red water. However, I was still encouraged to keep making dishes, from scratch.</p>
